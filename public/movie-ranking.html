<h2>TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>
  Simply the most iconic film of all time imo. <br />
  This has been my first favourite movie, since I was a kid, and it was also the
  film I was sharing with my best friend.
</p>
<h3>Indiana Jones 3</h3>
<p>
   I like the vibes of this movie. There's history, Venice, action, nazis... What
  else should you need?
</p>
<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<p>
  Here's another film that means a lot to me... it was shared with my bf.<br />
  <strong>GO GIPSY!!</strong>
